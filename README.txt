<h2>üîç <strong>Why Hashpeek</strong></h2>

<p>One will wonder why create a new hash identifier (hashpeek) when there are so many hash identifiers out there. <strong>You are right to question this tool.</strong></p>

<p>There are many hash identifiers out there but they seem to have one limitation or the other.</p>

<p><strong>Some don't accept input via stdin</strong> making it somehow difficult for scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Others too show outputs that are a hassle to grep</strong> (you need regex gymnastics to grep).</p>

<p><strong>Some too only accept hashes (no files)</strong> and those that accept hashfiles are prone to <strong>spamming your screen with redundant hashtypes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>These are the issues or limitations hashpeek is here to solve.</strong></p>

<h2>‚ú® <strong>Features</strong></h2>

<h3>* <strong>Bulk Hash Identification</strong></h3>

<p><code>hashpeek</code> checks hash identification in hash files (hash dumps), and what makes this special about <code>hashpeek</code> is that <strong>instead of spamming your screen with redundant hashtypes, it groups the hashes per similar hashtypes</strong> and then prints it out to you.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
You tried to identify the hashtypes of a file containing hundred hashes (all with the same hashtypes {md5}), instead of printing the hashtype of each hash, <strong>hashpeek groups the hashes as one</strong> (since they all have the same results) and shows only the hashtypes of one representing all.</p>

<h3>* <strong>Made for Automation or Scripting-Minded Users</strong></h3>

<p>Most hash identifiers assume the user needs to just identify the hash, but <strong>hashpeek allows you to easily grep and pipe its input to your preferred crscking tool.</strong> It also <strong>accepts input via stdin.</strong></p>

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Usage</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>With Hash</strong></h3>
<pre><code>./hashpeek -x 34850bfc40a15d3783447f344db0bcde
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3><strong>With HashFiles</strong></h3>
<pre><code>./hashpeek -f hashed.txt
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Accepting Input From Stdin</strong></h3>
<p><em>&gt; this is for recursive file parsing</em></p>
<pre><code>ls mydirectory | ./hashpeek -f -
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Extract A Format (grep friendly usage)</strong></h3>
<pre><code>./hashpeek -x 34850bfc40a15d3783447f344db0bcde | grep 'Hashcat Mode:' | grep -v -- '--'
</code></pre>
